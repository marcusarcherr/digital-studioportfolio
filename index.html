    <h2>Pixelated</h2>
    <p>
        The Pixelated project was surprisingly fun and much more approachable than I expected. 
        I had never made pixel art before, so learning how simple and effective the process can 
        be was a great experience. I created this in Photoshop and ended up using some of the 
        techniques I learned here in other classes. I definitely see myself using pixel-style 
        methods in future creative work.

<section id="badphotoshop">
    <h2>Bad Photoshop</h2>
    <p>
        This assignment let me be creative in a funny, expressive way. I had completely forgotten 
        about the photo of my head spinning like a basketball, and bringing it back for this 
        project made the whole process really fun. The playful nature of the assignment even helped 
        influence a collage I made in Ideas & Concepts later in the semester.

<section id="perfectmask">
    <h2>Perfect Mask</h2>
    <p>
        Perfect Mask reminded me of collage work I had done in 2D Design with Mr. Pinkard, so the 
        techniques felt familiar but still challenging. I really liked this project and think my 
        results turned out strong. The content-aware fill, masking, and cropping strategies I used 
        here have already helped me in other classes, and I'm glad I gained more confidence in 
        these tools.

<section id="animatedgif">
    <h2>Animated GIF</h2>
    <p>
        My animated GIF didn’t turn out great, but I learned a lot from the struggle. I tried making 
        it frame-by-frame in Photoshop, which ended up being way more complicated than it needed to 
        be. A classmate told me there was a much easier method. Even though the final GIF is rough, 
        I walked away understanding animation timing, layers, and the basics much better.

<section id="glitchgrit">
    <h2>Glitch & Grit</h2>
    <p>
        This was the hardest project for me by far. I worked on it during a road trip to Miami, 
        which meant poor internet, a cramped environment, and lots of frustration. Still, the 
        project reminded me of my intermediate programming class and pushed me to problem-solve 
        creatively. Even though it was tough, I’m proud that I stuck with it and completed it.

<section id="p5portrait">
    <h2>P5.js Portrait</h2>
    <p>
        The P5.js Portrait assignment was a unique experience unlike anything I had done before. 
        I had never heard of this method of digital drawing, so experimenting with it was exciting. 
        The process was new and different from Photoshop or Illustrator, but I enjoyed figuring out 
        how it works and creating something that felt one-of-a-kind.

<section id="whatif">
    <h2>What If</h2>
    <p>
        For the What If project, I loved being able to work in my own style and explore an idea that 
        felt both strange and creative. My concept of hackers expanding the moon made me think of 
        comic book storytelling, and I even considered taking a comic book class next semester 
        because of it. This project let me build something imaginative that I could easily expand 
        into a bigger visual narrative.
